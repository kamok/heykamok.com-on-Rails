              <h4>Professionally</h4>
              <p>I was exposed to the world of programming when I began collaborating with developers as a designer in University. I often felt powerless and frustrated after delivering the plans for the product (wire-frames, assets, research) as my developers struggle to meet our planned deadlines. To ease the workload of my teammates, I began tinkering with front-end. A year later and with the help of a <a href="http://dylanerichards.com/">great teacher</a>, I became a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer.<br>
              My goal is to develop a product or a service that has lasting impact on the most amount of people possible.</p>

              <h4>Personally</h4>
              <p>I left Hong Kong and came to the United States when I was 8. As a child, I was told that I always asked "why?" which annoyed a lot of people who didn't have the answers. However, I came to appreciate that the same curiosity is the driving force of my intellectual development. It is something far greater than the possession of intellect as without motivation, we stagnate. Without urgency, we are complacent. And without the thirst for knowledge, we are ridding ourselves that which distinguishes us from creatures which cannot contemplate its surroundings, drifting through life as it goes by, without the ability to detect nor see opportunities to further the development of the mind.</p>
