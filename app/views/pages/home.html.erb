              <h4><b>Professionally</b></h4>
              <h4>I was exposed to the world of programming when I began collaborating with developers as a designer in University. I often felt powerless and frustrated after delivering the plans for the product (wire-frames, assets, research). To ease the workload of my teammates, I began tinkering with front-end. A year later and with the help of a <a href="http://dylanerichards.com/">great teacher</a>, I became a Ruby on Rails developer.</h4>
              <h4>My goal is to develop a product or a service that has lasting impact on the most amount of people possible.</h4>

              <h4><b>Personally</b></h4>
              <h4>I left Hong Kong and came to the United States when I was 8. I went through English as a Second Language in elementary school and was fortunate to be admitted to Brooklyn Technical High School.</h4>

              <h4>
              I never had any particular interests, but performed well enough to get a near full scholarship to Parsons School of Design. At Parsons I discovered my intellectual curiosity after being unchallenged from the regular curriculum. That extra energy allowed me to reach for opportunities that went beyond the pursuit of grades, syllabi, bachelors degrees and into the development of the mind.</h4>
